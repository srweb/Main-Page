Special Events

Author's Night - November 6, 2013

This year's free admission event, scheduled for November 6 at 7:00 p.m. in the SRHS auditorium will feature cartoonist and author Stephan Pastis in conversation with Press Democrat columnist Chris Smith, whose services contribute greatly to the success of the event.

While Stephan is not a SRHS alumnus, he is a Panther in his heart as his wife is an alumnae and his son is a SRHS junior this year. Stephan earned a BA in Political Science at UC Berkeley, and his degree is from UCLA. After practicing law for a number of years, he decided to follow his interest in cartooning.

His comic strip Pearls Before Swine is published in over 600 newspapers around the world and has developed a huge following of all ages.  His first novel Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made was on the New York Times best seller list for six weeks.  His second book, Timmy Failure: Now You've Done It was recently published.

Copperfield's Books will be present to sell copies of Stephan's books, and he will autograph the books at the evening's conclusion.

You won't want to miss this year's event that promises to be well attended.  Circle the date on your calendars now!
